//! # Delta Kernel
//!
//! Delta-kernel-rs is an experimental [Delta](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/) implementation
//! focused on interoperability with a wide range of query engines. It currently only supports
//! reads. This library defines a number of traits which must be implemented to provide a
//! working "delta reader". The are detailed below. There is a provided "default client" that
//! implenents all these traits and can be used to ease integration work. See
//! [`DefaultEngine`](client/default/index.html) for more information.
//!
//! A full `rust` example for reading table data using the default client can be found
//! [here](https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-kernel-rs/blob/main/kernel/examples/dump-table/src/main.rs)
//!
//! # Engine traits
//!
//! The [`Engine`] trait allow connectors to bring their own implementation of functionality such as
//! reading parquet files, listing files in a file system, parsing a JSON string etc.  This trait
//! exposes methods to get sub-clients which expose the core functionalities customizable by
//! connectors.
//!
//! ## Expression handling
//!
//! Expression handling is done via the [`ExpressionHandler`], which in turn allows the creation
//! of [`ExpressionEvaluator`]s. These evaluators are created for a specific predicate [`Expression`]
//! and allow evaluation of that predicate for a specific batches of data.
//!
//! ## File system interactions
//!
//! Delta Kernel needs to perform some basic operations against file systems like listing and reading files.
//! These interactions are encapsulated in the [`FileSystemClient`] trait. Implementors must take take
//! care that all assumptions on the behavior if the functions - like sorted results - are respected.
//!
//! ## Reading log and data files
//!
//! Delta Kernel requires the capability to read json and parquet files, which is exposed via the
//! [`JsonHandler`] and [`ParquetHandler`] respectively. When reading files, connectors are asked to
//! provide the context information it requires to execute the actual read. This is done by invoking
//! methods on the [`FileSystemClient`] trait.
