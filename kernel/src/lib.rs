//! # TableClient interfaces
//!
//! The TableClient interfaces allow connectors to bring their own implementation of functionality
//! such as reading parquet files, listing files in a file system, parsing a JSON string etc.
//!
//! The [`TableClient`] trait exposes methods to get sub-clients which expose the core
//! functionalitites customizable by connectors.
//!
//! ## Expression handling
//!
//! Expression handling is done via the [`ExpressionHandler`], which in turn allows the creation
//! of [`ExpressionEvaluator`]s. These evaluators are created for a specific predicate [`Expression`]
//! and allow evaluation of that predicate for a specific batches of data.
//!
//! ## File system interactions
//!
//! Delta Kernel needs to perform some basic operations against file systems like listing and reading files.
//! These interactions are encapsulated in the [`FileSystemClient`] trait. Implementors must take take
//! care that all assumtions on the behavior if the functions - like sorted results - are respected.
//!
//! ## Reading log and data files
//!
//! Delta Kernel requires the capability to read json and parquet files, which is exposed via the
//! [`JsonHandler`] and [`ParquetHandler`] respectively. When reading files, connectors are asked
//! to provide the context imformation it requires to execute the actual read. This is done by
//! invoking methods on the [`FileHandler`] trait. All specifc file handlers must also provide
//! the contextualization APis.
